Analyse the Fisher's Iris data set

# Introduction : 
Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936, as an example of linear discriminant analysis i.e. a method used in statistics to find a linear combination of features that characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events. In this study, Fisher wished to investigate if the species of an Iris flower could be identified by examining its petal and sepal length and width.

# Purpose of Task
Analyse the Iris Fisher Data Set
Write a program called analysis.py that:
1. Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file,
2. Saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and
3. Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.
4. Performs any other analysis you think is appropriate

# Installation
Run the python program analysis.py in Visual Studio Code
